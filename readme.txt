Plugin to integrate Google's products in WordPress with particular attention to the widgets provided by the social network Google+. The Google products are many and so this plugin will be a kind of development "step to step" which will be developed a little bit at a time depending on the availability of time that we can devote. In any case, we will always be willing to consider new requests for anyone who wants to ask for a new feature to be developed in the plugin. Write all your requests on our <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/109254048492234113886">official page</a>.

To be informed about the features that gradually will be released you can follow this link page <a href="http://startbyzero.com/webmaster/wordpress-plugin/sz-google/">Plugin SZ-Google</a>, which will be a sort of official article where as I integrate the new features released, otherwise you can follow the community of <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/109254048492234113886">WordPress Italy+</a> where surely will be included the latest news that will affect this plugin. The plugin sz-google contain several modules, we recommend you activate from the admin panel only the functions that you will use and do not use unnecessary memory resources.

= Google+ social network module =
**<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sz-google/"> </a>**

**Google+ Badge:** With this plugin can be inserted in your blog most of the badges available to google for its social network, for example, we can use the badge for profiles, one for the pages or the one dedicated to the community. These components can be used as a widget for use in or as a sidebar and as shortcode to use in the articles. You can also use the php functions to customize your own theme directly with programming code.

**Google+ Custom URL:** It is already some time that Google has released the function of custom URLs for pages and profiles, however, the majority of profiles and pages can not yet take advantage of this possibility. So in the plugin-google sz we added this feature to be able to generate custom links such as domino.com/+ or dominio.com/plus.

**Google+ Comments System:** The comment system must be explicitly enabled from the admin panel after installing the plugin. You can replace the current commenting system or integrate it with the existing getting a double system. You can choose the position of the new widget comments, wishing you can also insert into a sidebar using the dedicated widget. At the commenting system has been added to the reference date for activation, for example, if someone has the need to maintain the old system to the old posts and activate it only for new ones can enter a date for when the new system is only activated if the date of the post and greater than or equal to this date.

= Plugin and general performance =
**<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sz-google/"> </a>**

Given that in the plugin will be implemented different function that will not be used in most of the times all together, the plugin has been written with a technique of "separate modules" in such a way to load the code only if the administration panel is activated explicitly requested function. For this reason, activated only the functions you use.
