You can replace the current commenting system or integrate it with the existing getting a double system. You can choose the position of the new widget comments, wishing you can also insert into a sidebar using the dedicated widget. At the commenting system has been added to the reference date for activation, for example, if someone has the need to maintain the old system to the old posts and activate it only for new ones can enter a date for when the new system is only activated if the date of the post and greater than or equal to this date.

**Google+ Custom URL:** It is already some time that Google has released the function of custom URLs for pages and profiles, however, the majority of profiles and pages can not yet take advantage of this possibility.
